#####Story 1

In a fixed deposit account, when I deposit a certain principal amount and at a given rate of interest (per annum), provide a mechanism to calculate the amount I will be able to withdraw at the end of any given duration (in years). For example, if I deposit $100 and get interest at the rate of 8%, I should be able to withdraw $108 at the end of the first year.

#####Story 2

In a fixed deposit account, when I deposit a certain principal amount and at a given rate of interest (per annum), provide a mechanism to calculate the schedule of interest gains. The schedule should provide the accrued intersest at the end of each year. For example, a deposit of $100 should accrue $8 at the end of the first year, $16.64 at the end of the second year, $25.9712 at the end of the third year etc.
